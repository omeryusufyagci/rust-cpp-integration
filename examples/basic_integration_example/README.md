# Basic Integration Example

This example demonstrates the fundamental steps required to integrate a Rust library into an existing C++ codebase as a shared object. 

It serves as an introductory guide to Rust-C++ interoperability, showcasing how Rust can be used within a legacy C++ project.

## Key Concepts
* **Basic FFI Integration**: Demonstrates how to expose Rust code to C++ using the Foreign Function Interface (FFI).
* **Cross-Language Integration**: Illustrates how to wrap Rust structs and extend them in C++, allowing native extension of Rust APIs within C++.
* **Architecture-Targeted Compilation**: Demonstrates cross-compilation by building the Rust library (`.so` file) with an architecture-targeted flag, such as `x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu`. 
    * **Note**: Previously, this example included cross-distribution builds (e.g., building on one Linux distribution and using the library on another). With the streamlined Dockerfiles, this specific use case has been removed. If thereâ€™s interest, it can be reintroduced as a dedicated example.

## How to run

From project root, run:

```bash
scripts/launcher.sh  # Select `Basic Integration Example`
```

### Expected Output

You should see the following output:

```
CustomGreeter says: Hello from C++, extending a Rust Struct!
Hello from RustGreeter! My name is Stack Allocated C++ User
CustomGreeter says: Hello from C++, extending a Rust Struct!
Hello from RustGreeter! My name is Heap Allocated C++ User
CustomGreeter says: Hello from C++, extending a Rust Struct!
Hello from RustGreeter! My name is Smart Pointer C++ User
```

Explanation
* **Rust Code**: Implements a RustGreeter struct and a Greeter trait, exposing functions to C++ via FFI. This allows C++ to interact with Rust as if it were a native library.
* **C++ Code**: Demonstrates how to utilize the Rust library by integrating it into a C++ project.
